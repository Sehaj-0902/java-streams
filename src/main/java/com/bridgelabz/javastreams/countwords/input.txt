FileReader:
FileReader is a character-stream class used to read text files.
It reads characters directly from the file, which can be inefficient for large files due to frequent disk access.
It lacks buffering, so each read operation often involves a physical disk read.

BufferedReader:
BufferedReader is a character-stream class that adds buffering to a character input stream, such as a FileReader.
It reads a larger chunk of data from the file into an internal buffer, reducing the number of disk access operations.
This buffering significantly improves performance, especially when reading large text files, by minimizing the overhead of disk I/O.
